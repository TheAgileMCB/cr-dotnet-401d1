# 401 ASP.NET Core Curriculum Overview

The ASP.NET curriculum is broken up into three main modules:
1. Intro to C#
1. ASP.NET Web Development
1. React

## Module 1 - Into to C#
This module consists of introduction to C#. You will spend the next 10 classes
teaching the students C# and getting them ready to go into ASP.NET Core web development. ASP.NET Core assumes
an intermediate knowledge of C#, so we have 10 classes to get the students to that level. The focus
on these 2 weeks is primarily computer-science related and does not work with the web. The lab assignments are all
console apps and focus on practicing the c# concepts taught daily.
