# Component Based UI

Component based UI systems like `React`, `Angular`, `Vue` and the like all operate on a variation of "Atomic Design", using "Components" as the means of delivery.

"Thinking in React" means re-evaluating how you look at a web application: Breaking down it's functional parts, data dependencies, behaviors, and styles into independent, deliverable, re-usable components.

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define

- SASS - Nesting and Variables
- "Component Architecture"
- Application and Component "State"
- Debate/Discuss Libraries vs Frameworks
- Basics of a React App
  - index.html in public (root div)
  - index.js as an untouchable "bootstrap" or "entry point"
  - React Renders into that div
  - JSX is actually javascript but it looks like markup
  - Components can be classes or functions. What gets "returned" gets "rendered"
    - Class - `render() { return(jsx) }`
    - Function - `return(jsx)`
  - Components can load and render each other
  - Components can load their own css

#### Execute

- Begin a React project locally with `create-react-app`
- Use codesandbox.io to work live on a React application
- Create and render `Class` and `Functional` React components to the DOM
- Add event listeners to React components
- Update React component state
- Style React applications/components using SASS
